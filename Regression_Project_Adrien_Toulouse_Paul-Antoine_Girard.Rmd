## Introduction

Our task is to analyze the dataset named **House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques**. It contains the sale price of about 1500 residential homes located in Ames, Iowa, along with 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of the houses. The dataset has already been preprocessed to deal with missing values, so we will work on a reduced dataset containing 68 variables.

Our aim within this project is to focus on dimensionality reduction by doing a variable selection. Variable selection can be defined as selecting a subset of the most relevant features.  
The objectives of feature selection include: building simpler and more comprehensible models, improving performance, and preparing clean, and understandable data. Indeed, with a large number of features, learning models tend to overfit which may cause performance degradation on unseen data.

We can, therefore, address the following question: **What are the most relevant features to explain the sale price of houses of the dataset?**

To answer this question we will first analyze the variables and assess their relevance by looking at their correlation with the regression target: *SalePrice*. We will also build and compare several linear regression models with different numbers of variables and finally conclude on the relevance of the features. Our work will be focused on finding the best linear prediction model using a minimum number of variables. We can, therefore, state our research hypothesis as follows:  
**Can we construct a performant linear regression model by selecting only the most appropriate variables? How does it compare to larger or other models?**


## Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r imports}
trainImputed <- read.csv(file='train_imputed.csv')
trainPP <- read.csv(file='train_preprocessed.csv')
```

### 1. Transformations

We start by looking at the data to see how it is structured.  
The histogram for the response variable *SalePrice* shows that it is skewed. So, a first transformation we do is to take the log of the house prices to reduce the effect of the tail in its density.

```{r log transformation}
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
plot(density(trainImputed$SalePrice), main='SalePrice density', sub='', xlab='', ylab='')
trainImputed$LogSalePrice <- log(trainImputed$SalePrice)
trainImputed <- select(trainImputed, -c("SalePrice", "X")) #X is unrelated to our study
plot(density(trainImputed$LogSalePrice), main='Log SalePrice density', sub='', xlab='', ylab='')
```

We observe the same particularity for the variables *LotArea*, *TotalBsmtSF* and *GrLivAreado*. So we do similar transformations for these variables.

```{r log transformation 2}
trainImputed$LogLotArea <- log(trainImputed$LotArea)
trainImputed$LogTotalBsmtSF <- log(trainImputed$TotalBsmtSF)
trainImputed$LogGrLivArea <- log(trainImputed$GrLivArea)
trainImputed <- select(trainImputed, -c("LotArea", "TotalBsmtSF", "GrLivArea"))
```

### 2. Numeric variables

Looking at the numeric variables, we analyze the correlation between the different variables together as well as their correlation with *LogSalePrice*.  
The first step is very important when trying to see which variables are the most important to explain price since there might be multicollinearity problems. Indeed we know that having correlated response variables is not efficient in linear models and detecting strong correlations will allow us to create a reduced model. Some variables like for example *YearBuilt* and *YearRemodAdd* are very strongly correlated. So we will not need to keep both variables.  
Secondly, we look at the correlations with our response variables to see which variables explain the house sale price well. The regressor *Overallqual* is particularly interesting as it rates the overall material and finish of the house.

```{r correlation}
#var.numeric <- colnames(trainPP)[sapply(trainPP, is.numeric)]
#
#trainPP %>%
#  select(var.numeric) %>%
#  cor() %>%
#  corrplot(method = 'color', order = "hclust", tl.pos = 'n') %>%
#  heatmap (symm=T)
```

Some variables like for example YearBuilt and YearRemodAdd are very strongly correlated and we will not need to keep both variables.

```{r plot 1}
ggplot(trainImputed, aes(YearBuilt, YearRemodAdd)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=lm)
```

Let's now look at the correlations with our response variables to see which variables explain the house sale price well.

```{r plot 2}
ggplot(trainImputed, aes(OverallQual, LogSalePrice)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=lm)
```


```{r plot 3}
ggplot(trainImputed, aes(LogTotalBsmtSF, LogSalePrice)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=lm)
```

For example, *Overallqual* and *LogTotalBsmtSF* impact *LogSalePrice* as the scatter plots show what looks like a linear relationship. By plotting other scatter plots, we found that the variables *YearBuilt*, *YearRemodAdd*, *MasvnrArea*, *BsmtFinSF1*, *X1stFlrSF*, *LogGrLiveArea* are also strongly correlated with the price. Including these predictors in our model should therefore be performant.

The regressor *Overallqual* is particularly interesting as it rates the overall material and finish of the house. It is a kind of summary of other variables, so it can help us to reduce the size of our model as it explains well the price.

### 3. Factor variables

Concerning categorical variables, a variable will be interesting in our model if it has different boxplots for each category when considering *SalePrice*, as this will indicate a clear dependency between the two variables.

```{r plot 4}
ggplot(data = trainImputed) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(y=LogSalePrice, x = MSZoning))
```

We remark that the variable *MSZoning* corresponds to this situation. Indeed, these boxplots are quite different visually from one another which indicates that MSZoning is an important variable to explain the Sale Price.

```{r Anova}
res.aov <- aov(LogSalePrice ~ MSZoning, data = trainImputed)
summary(res.aov)
```

This is confirmed by the one way Anova test as the p-value is less than the significance level 0.05. We can conclude that there are significant differences between the *MSZoning* categories when considering the *LogSalePrice* and make us say that we should include *MSZoning* in our model.

```{r plot 5}
ggplot(data = trainImputed) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(y=LogSalePrice, x = GarageQual))
```

```{r Anova 2}
res.aov <- aov(LogSalePrice ~ GarageQual, data = trainImputed)
summary(res.aov)
```

We find similar results when looking at the *GarageQual* variable. However, the boxplots do not completely follow intuition as they indicate that on average houses with garages in excellent quality have a lower sale price that garages in good quality. This reveals that garage quality is not a key variable when trying to explain the sale price of a house.

We also note that some categorical variables like for example *RoofMatl* are not very interesting to explain sale price as they are too heavily unbalanced (almost all the observations take the value Compshg and we have only one observation for some of the other roof material types). This is also the case for *Condition2*.

```{r values RoofMatl/Condition2}
table(trainImputed$RoofMatl)
table(trainImputed$Condition2)
```

### 4. Ancova analysis

Now we plot two quantitative variables together with one factor variable.

```{r Ancova}
p <- ggplot(trainImputed, aes(y=LogSalePrice, x=LogGrLivArea, color = MSZoning, fill = MSZoning)) +
  geom_point() + theme_classic()
p + stat_smooth(method = "lm")
```

This graph helps to make clear that while *GrLiveArea* has a large predictive effect for *LogSalePrice* (the slopes of all the lines are clearly non-zero), there is also an effect of group assignment: for example the houses assigned to the FV MSZoning have a higher Sale Price than the houses assigned to RH.  

### 5. Key findings from EDA

To sum up, our findings from this first part are the following:  

1. We used a log transformation on the sale price to reduce the impact of the tail in its distribution.  
2. The variables *YearBuilt* and *YearRemodAdd* as well as the variables *LotArea* and *LotFrontage* are highly correlated two by two.  
3. The numeric variables *LogTotalBsmtSF*, *LogGrLivArea*, *OverallQual*, *OverallCond*, *LogLotArea* are interesting when explaining Sale Price because they are highly correlated with our response variables.  
4. The factor variables *MSZoning*, *CentralAir*, *BsmtQual*, *KitchenQual* are interesting when explaining Sale Price because of the large difference in each category boxplots. Some variables like *Roofmatl* are highly unbalanced which is not very interesting for our model.  
5. We have confirmed our intuitions with statistical tests and have ploted numeric and factor variables together with Ancova plots.  

Now that we have more information on our data, let's build multiple linear models. We will start from the full model and then use our findings from this exploratory analysis part as well as other techniques to select variables and build better models.

## Modeling and Diagnostics

In this part, we are going to build different linear regression models and analyse their differences to select the one that we think fits the best our research hypothesis.

### 1. Full model

As we did at the beginning, we need to take the log of the variable *SalePrice*.

```{r log transformation 3}
trainPP$LogSalePrice <- log(trainPP$SalePrice)
trainPP <- select(trainPP, -c("SalePrice", "X")) #X is not related to our study
```

First, we start by doing a linear regression with all the variables of the dataset.

```{r full lm}
full_model = lm(LogSalePrice ~ ., data = trainPP)
summary(full_model)
#summary(full_model)$coefficient[,4]
AIC(full_model)
```

As we explained in the introduction, our interest in this study is to select variables that explain the best our model. Some of the variables are irrelevant if we consider the p-values related to Student test. At a significance level of 0.001, this technique suggests us to only keep the following variables: *MSZoning*, *LotArea*, *OverallQual*, *OverallCond*, *YearBuilt*, *YearRemodAdd*, *RoofMatl*, *TotalBsmtSF*, *CentralAir*, *GrLivArea*, *KitchenQual*, *Fireplaces*, and *GarageQual*. Concerning the qualitative variables, we decide to only keep the one that have many categories that are relevant for the model at a significance level of 0.001, and not only one category (that is the case for the followings: *Condition1*, *Condition2*, *Heating*, *Functional*).  
Overall, this full model has a $R^2$ coefficient of 0.94 (can't be improve since we can't add new variables), a $R^2_a$ of 0.93, and a AIC of -2314.3. The F test statistic yields a very low p-value, that shows that the model is meaningful at a level of 0.05.  
Let's check if the residuals verify the postulates neccessary to valid the linear model.

```{r postulates 1}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(full_model)
```

```{r tests 1}
acf(residuals(full_model), main='Auto-correlation plot')
ncvTest(full_model)
durbinWatsonTest(full_model)
shapiro.test(residuals(full_model))
```

The residuals seem to have a mean of zero and they are uncorrelated. However, the other assumptions do not look verified. We check it by running a Breush-Pagan, and a Shapiro-Wilk tests. Both of them give a p-value that is lower than 0.05. So, the hypotheses of homoscedastic variance, and gaussian distribution are rejected at a significance level of 5%. Finally, none of the residuals have a cook distance larger than 1. Note that R informs us that it didn't plot a few points that have a leverage of one. These points mean the fitted value corresponds exactly to the observed value. Since we have many regressors in this model, this is explained by the fact that certain combinations of modalities are associated to only 1 observation. Therefore, we need to work on our selection of variables to reduce the number of regressors, and define a reduced model that verifies the assumptions required for its validity.

```{r outliers 1}
outlierTest(full_model)
```

### 2. Model using the backward method

We now use methods based on minimizing the AIC to automatically select a reduced number of variables for our model. For the forward method, at each step the model adds the variable which reduces the most the criterion, and stops when adding a variable doesn't improve the accuracy of the model.

```{r forward}
reg0=lm(LogSalePrice~1,data=trainPP)
select.variables.forward = step(reg0, LogSalePrice~MSSubClass+MSZoning+LotFrontage+LotArea+Street+LotShape+LandContour+Utilities+LotConfig+LandSlope+Neighborhood+Condition1+Condition2+BldgType+HouseStyle+OverallQual+OverallCond+YearBuilt+YearRemodAdd+RoofStyle+RoofMatl+Exterior1st+Exterior2nd+MasVnrType+MasVnrArea+ExterQual+ExterCond+Foundation+BsmtQual+BsmtCond+BsmtExposure+BsmtFinType1+BsmtFinSF1+BsmtFinType2+BsmtUnfSF+TotalBsmtSF+Heating+HeatingQC+CentralAir+Electrical+X1stFlrSF+X2ndFlrSF+GrLivArea+BsmtFullBath+BsmtHalfBath+FullBath+HalfBath+BedroomAbvGr+KitchenQual+TotRmsAbvGrd+Functional+Fireplaces+GarageType+GarageYrBlt+GarageFinish+GarageCars+GarageArea+GarageQual+GarageCond+PavedDrive+WoodDeckSF+OpenPorchSF+MoSold+YrSold+SaleType+SaleCondition, data=trainPP, trace=FALSE, direction=c('forward'))
summary(select.variables.forward)
```

```{r both}
reg0=lm(LogSalePrice~1,data=trainPP)
select.variables.both = step(reg0, LogSalePrice~MSSubClass+MSZoning+LotFrontage+LotArea+Street+LotShape+LandContour+Utilities+LotConfig+LandSlope+Neighborhood+Condition1+Condition2+BldgType+HouseStyle+OverallQual+OverallCond+YearBuilt+YearRemodAdd+RoofStyle+RoofMatl+Exterior1st+Exterior2nd+MasVnrType+MasVnrArea+ExterQual+ExterCond+Foundation+BsmtQual+BsmtCond+BsmtExposure+BsmtFinType1+BsmtFinSF1+BsmtFinType2+BsmtUnfSF+TotalBsmtSF+Heating+HeatingQC+CentralAir+Electrical+X1stFlrSF+X2ndFlrSF+GrLivArea+BsmtFullBath+BsmtHalfBath+FullBath+HalfBath+BedroomAbvGr+KitchenQual+TotRmsAbvGrd+Functional+Fireplaces+GarageType+GarageYrBlt+GarageFinish+GarageCars+GarageArea+GarageQual+GarageCond+PavedDrive+WoodDeckSF+OpenPorchSF+MoSold+YrSold+SaleType+SaleCondition, data=trainPP, trace=FALSE, direction=c('both'))
summary(select.variables.both)
```

```{r backward}
select.variables.backward = step(full_model, scope= ~1, direction=c("backward"), trace=FALSE)
summary(select.variables.backward)
```

```{r AICs}
AIC(select.variables.forward)
AIC(select.variables.both)
AIC(select.variables.backward)
```

The three methods (forward, backward, both) lead to the same model that has an AIC value of -2382.3. Comparing AICs this model is better than the full model, and also selects less variables. The F-test gives a low p-value, so it is meaningful. Finally, if we look at the Student tests done, we obtain the same variables as before and two additional variables: *BsmtQual*, *BsmtFinSF1*.

Now, let's take a look at the residuals to see if the postulates are now valid, and if the number of observations with leverage 1 is reduced.

```{r postulates 2}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(select.variables.forward)
```

```{r tests 2}
acf(residuals(select.variables.forward), main='Auto-correlation plot')
ncvTest(select.variables.forward)
durbinWatsonTest(select.variables.forward)
shapiro.test(residuals(select.variables.forward))
```

The residuals still don't verify the assumptions needed for the validity of our model. As before, the mean seem to be zero, but the others assumptions aren't verified. The Breush-Pagan, Durbin-Watson, and Shapiro-Wlik tests give all of them a p-value that is lower than 0.05. In addition, there are still observations that aren't plotted because they have a leverage of one. Therefore, we need to reduce even more the number of variables. To do so, we will use our work from the descriptive statistics.

### 3. Reduced model based on the Student tests and our EDA work

In this part, we are going to construct a model based on the regressors selected by the p-values of the Student tests realized for each variable in the linear regression model obtained by the forward method, and by our work done in the first part of the study.  

In order to obtain a model that verify the assumptions needed in a linear model, we first wanted to use the transformations made in the first part, but how the variables have been encoded don't let us apply the log transformations (some values are now negative).  

Our base model contains all the following variables selected in the part II:  *MSZoning*, *LotArea*, *OverallQual*, *OverallCond*, *YearBuilt*, *YearRemodAdd*, *RoofMatl*, *TotalBsmtSF*, *CentralAir*, *GrLivArea*, *KitchenQual*, *Fireplaces*, *GarageQual*, *BsmtQual*, and *BsmtFinSF1*.  
From there we decided to remove the variables *YearRemodAdd*, *RoofMatl*, *CentralAir*, *KitchenQual*, *BsmtFinSF1*, *GarageQual* and to add *Neighborhood*, and *GarageCars*.  

Indeed, as we saw in our previous analysis, the numeric variables *TotalBsmtSF*, *GrLivArea*, *OverallQual*, *OverallCond*, *LotArea* are interesting when explaining Sale Price because they are highly correlated with our response variables. The factor variables *MSZoning*, *Neighborhood*, *GarageCars* and *Fireplaces* are also interesting when explaining Sale Price because of the large difference in each category boxplots. 
We removed the factor variable *Roofmatl* which is not very interesting because it is highly unbalanced and the variable *YearRemodAdd* because of its high correlation with *YearBuilt*.  

Our reduced model is finally composed of: *MSZoning*, *LotArea*, *OverallQual*, *OverallCond*, *YearBuilt*, *TotalBsmtSF*, *GrLivArea*, *Neighborhood*, *GarageCars*, *Fireplaces*.

Finally, we decided to remove two observations. We observed that the observations 524 and 1299 have a low cook distance compare to others (however not exceeding 1), and their associated studentized residuals are also very low. Therefore, they are regression outliers, and since the p-value of the Bonferroni test are very low, we decided to remove them from the dataset to be sure that they don't influence our predictions.

```{r outliers 3}
influenceIndexPlot(lm(LogSalePrice ~ MSZoning + LotArea + OverallQual + 
                     OverallCond + YearBuilt + TotalBsmtSF + 
                     GrLivArea + Neighborhood + GarageCars + Fireplaces, 
                   data = trainPP))
```

Let's train the model with our selected variables to see how the postulates are verified and if there are outliers, and observations with leverage one.
    
```{r reduced_model}
reduced_model = lm(LogSalePrice ~ MSZoning + LotArea + OverallQual + OverallCond + YearBuilt + TotalBsmtSF + GrLivArea + Neighborhood + GarageCars + Fireplaces, data = trainPP[-c(524, 1299),])
summary(reduced_model)
AIC(reduced_model)
```

We can observe that most of the variables still have a p-value for the Student tests that are smaller than 0.01, except for some of the categories of the variable *Neighborhood*.
The F-statistic yields that the model is meaningful, but the AIC is larger than before, and the $R^2$, $R^2_a$ coefficients are smaller. Therefore, the model selection criterions don't go in favor of this reduced model, but we now have only 10 features out of 68 at the beginning.

```{r postulates 3}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(reduced_model)
```

```{r tests 3}
acf(residuals(reduced_model), main='Auto-correlation plot')
ncvTest(reduced_model)
durbinWatsonTest(reduced_model)
shapiro.test(residuals(reduced_model))
```

Then, by looking at the model assumptions, we observe that the mean of the residuals is still zero, and the residuals are uncorrelated. The homoscedastic variance seems satisfied on the Scale Location plot, but the Breush-Pagan test still returns a p-value lower than the 5% treshold, that suggests us to reject the homoscedastic variance hypothesis. This is the same case concerning the gaussian assumption, but tt could have been better if we could have use the log transformation on some variables as we stated before.  

```{r outliers 3.2}
outlierTest(reduced_model)
influenceIndexPlot(reduced_model)
```

### 4. Lasso Model

Finally, we do a Lasso regression which does automatic variable selection by putting some of the coefficients to zero. In fact, adding the $L^1$ penalization induces sparsity in the estimator.

```{r lasso}
lasso=train(LogSalePrice~., trainPP, method='glmnet', tuneGrid=expand.grid(alpha=1,lambda=seq(0.01,0.1,length=10)))
lasso$bestTune
```

```{r lasso important features}
varImp(lasso,scale=F)
```

The lasso regression gives us the variables that explain the most its predictions. We can observe that this method uses mainly the following regressors: *Condition2*, *GrLivArea*, *OverallQual*, *Neighborhood*, *Functional*, *CentralAir*, *YearBuilt*, *GarageCars*, *LotArea*, *SaleType*, *OverallCond*, *RoofMatl*, *Condition1*, *BsmtFinSF1*.  
We used some of these features in our reduced model, but lasso is less selective than our model and uses a lot more regressors. Therefore, it will be interesting to see how the two different models predict, and to compare their respective RMSE.

## Comparison of different models

In order to use the train-test split already done, we need to modify these two dataset as we have done in our study. 

```{r modifications train/test}
train <- train[ !(train$Id %in% c(1299,524)), ]
train$LogSalePrice <- log(train$SalePrice)
test$LogSalePrice <- log(test$SalePrice)
train <- select(train, -c("SalePrice", "Id"))
test<- select(test, -c("SalePrice", "Id"))
Ytrain = train$LogSalePrice
Ytest = test$LogSalePrice
```

We can now compare the score obtained by each model.

```{r predictions lasso}
lasso=train(LogSalePrice~., train, method='glmnet', tuneGrid=expand.grid(alpha=1,lambda=0.01))
RMSE_lasso_train=sqrt(mean((fitted(lasso)-Ytrain)^2))
RMSE_lasso_test=sqrt(mean((predict(lasso, newdata = test)-Ytest)^2))
print(RMSE_lasso_train)
print(RMSE_lasso_test)
```

```{r prediction reduced_model}
reduced_model = lm(LogSalePrice ~ MSZoning + LotArea + OverallQual + OverallCond + YearBuilt + TotalBsmtSF + GrLivArea + GarageCars + Fireplaces, data = train)
RMSE_lm_train=sqrt(mean((fitted(reduced_model)-Ytrain)^2))
RMSE_lm_test=sqrt(mean((predict(reduced_model, newdata = test)-Ytest)^2))
print(RMSE_lm_train)
print(RMSE_lm_test)
```

In order to compute the RMSE of our reduced model on the test dataset, we had to remove the variable *Neighborhood* of our linear model, because it takes values in the test dataset that aren't in the train dataset.  
The lasso regression model returns predictions that lead to an RMSE of 0.121 on the test dataset. By comparison, our reduced model has a RMSE of 0.136 on the same dataset. Therefore, we can state that our variable selection didn't improve the accuracy of our log predictions, but it's almost equal. We have only 10 features in our reduced model, and barely reach the same accuracy of prediction.

## Conclusion

Our analysis now allows us to provide answers to our initial questions. We have found which variables explained the most the sale price and built a reduced model using a minimum number of variables. We used only 10 variables out of 68 at the beginning, and we reached a correct score, compared to more complex model. Our reduced model is as good as the lasso model when trying to predict Sale Price (similar RMSE), and it has the advantage to use a lot less variables which makes it faster and more easily explainable.  
Our work can be improve by adapting the preproccesing to our study. In fact, we think that the way it was preprocessed influenced our work. We couldn't use the log transformations on some variables, and we think it could have helped us to verify the assumptions of a linear regression. Therefore, possible future directions of research can be how to preprocessed the data to have a linear model that verify all the assumptions needed for its validity. Also, it can be on the algorithm used to predict the sale price of the houses. Many different algorithms exists, and some models (for example gradient boosting algorithms) might be more adapted to reach the lowest score of prediction.
